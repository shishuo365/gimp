 * ScriptFu Server listens and responds to clients.

 * A client may also expect side-effects, e.g. on images and image files.
 *
 * The server has its own logging.
 * Its logging defaults to stdout, but optionally to a file.
 * The server logs errors in interpretation of the stream from the client.
 *
 * A client may quit the server by eval "(gimp-quit)"
 * Otherwise, the server blocks on IO from the client.
 *
 * A server that dies leaves the client with a broken connection,
 * but does not affect extension-script-fu.
 *
 * A server is a child process of a GIMP process.
 * Quitting or killing the parent process also kills the server.
