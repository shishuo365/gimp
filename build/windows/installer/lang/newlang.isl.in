; A template to create the basic lang file for languages which are not
; made available by InnoSetup, not even in the Unofficial/ folder.
; See full list of languages:
; https://github.com/jrsoftware/issrc/tree/main/Files/Languages
;
; Without this, they show as English in the
; start list so we must add a language name (localized preferably) at
; the very least.
; See also the docs for the meanings of different fields:
