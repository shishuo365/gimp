# GIMP MSIX HowTo

## Development releases

The MS Store/Partner Center hosts our development point releases:
https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/products/9NZVDVP54JMR/overview

Base rule to update the "GIMP (Preview)" entry:

* Regularly, an .msixupload will be generated at each tagged commit. It also can be
  with a custom pipeline valuating `GIMP_CI_MS_STORE` to `MSIXUPLOAD_${REVISION}`

## Maintaining the MSIX

1. The link above will open 'Partner Center', the frontend to submit .msixupload

2. With your Microsoft Entra ID account (@*onmicrosoft.com), log-in as costumary

3. Clicking on the "Start update" button will make possible to change some things.
  Only 'Packages' and 'Store listings' sections are needed. On 'Packages' you will
  add the generated .msixupload and on 'Store listings' the brief changelog.

## Versioning the MSIX

* Every new .msixupload submission (with different content) needs a bumped version.
  But MS Store reserves revisions (the fourth digit after last dot) for its own use.

  So, our MSIX have a special micro versioning to we have revisions. Check the .ps1.
